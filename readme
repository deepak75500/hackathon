flask
to ruun:
python app.py
Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
Time Window:
 Generates slots from 10:00 to 17:00 by default.
 Each slot is 1 hour long.
Demand Scoring (calculate_demand_score(hour)):
 Base demand is determined by time of day:
 High demand: 11 AM – 2 PM (+0.5)
 Moderate demand: 10 AM, 4 PM (+0.2)
 Other times: +0.35
 Adds a user bias (preference scores based on hour).
 Includes a weekday bias (+0.1).
 Adds a small random jitter to avoid deterministic patterns.
Slot Assignment (generate_slots()):
 For each hour in the range:
 If the total score > 0.65:
 Randomly assigns a staff member (e.g., “Alice”, “Bob”).
 Else:
 The slot is left unassigned (None = available).
